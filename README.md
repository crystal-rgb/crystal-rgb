*Hello*! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am a curios guy who seeks to have fun while writing libraries focused on performance. I will do anything to push even the most modern hardware to it's limit (grandma's laptop) for the last byte of performance.

# My areas of interests for these libraries are:

- Scientific computations

- Big data and machine learning

- Graphics and rendering

  

The common factor of these interests being the need for understanding how natural events and mechanisms can be approximated; in other words...applied *math*.
